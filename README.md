# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Synthetic Data Generation

This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model used to generate synthetic data from a credit card dataset. The primary goal is to create synthetic transactions to aid in the analysis and differentiation between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## Contents

- **GAN**: Implementation of the basic GAN model for synthetic data generation.

## Dataset

The code utilizes a credit card dataset that includes both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. The generated synthetic data can be used for training and testing machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.

## Requirements

To run the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn
```
## Results
The model will generate synthetic transaction data and visualize the results. The synthetic data can be used for further analysis to differentiate between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a resource for understanding and implementing GANs for synthetic data generation, particularly in the context of credit card transaction analysis. Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute!
